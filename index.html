                        overview of what the series is about: </b>
                    <b class="nine"> Annalise Keating (Viola Davis)</b> :<br>
                    Annalise is a formidable defence attorney and a professor at Middleton University. She
                    selects a group of her top law students to work for her at her law firm. Annalise is a complex
                    character who often finds
                    herself entangled in morally ambiguous situations.
                    <b class="nine"> The Keating Five:</b> The main narrative of the series revolves around a group of
                    five law students who are handpicked by
                    Annalise to work for her firm. These students become deeply involved in high-stakes, real-life legal
                    cases and are
                    forced to confront their own moral dilemmas.
                    <b class="nine">Murder Mysteries :</b> The series is framed around a series of murder mysteries. In
                    the very first episode, a murder takes
                    place, and the series unfolds as a series of flashbacks, flash-forwards, and present-day events as
                    viewers are kept in

                    <b class="nine">Character Development:</b> The show delves into the lives of the main characters,
                    exploring their personal and professional
                    struggles, secrets, and relationships.
                    <b class="nine">Legal Cases:</b> Each season features a different legal case that Annalise and her
                    students are tasked with solving or
                    defending. These cases often intersect with the main murder mystery storyline.
                    The series is known for its intricate plot twists, morally complex characters, and its exploration
                    of themes such as
                    justice, ethics, and the consequences of one's actions. It received critical acclaim and has a
                    dedicated fan following.
                    If you enjoy legal dramas with elements of mystery and suspense, "How to Get Away with Murder" is a
                    series worth

    </b>
<div class="art" id="info" style="display: none;">
Wether you have just started watching this show, don't know it at all or have rewtached How To Get Away With Murder 20 times and still can't get enough of it‚ù£Ô∏è. I personally find Matt McGorry who plays Asher Millstone, a very cliche character, but has a way deeper emotinal famliarty that just tugs at your heart to all the viewers. In the show Asher was a boy who was born into a really wealthy family and whos father comes from a long line of lots of known prosecutors in Philadelphia. Right off the batt, most viewers would veiw Asher as a spoiled bratty enitttled law school frat boy who just will end up like his father,but that is from our POV. Asher although he grew up with the best of the best, he was  just the type of person who always wanted to  better everyone else and be a unit with people and do right by others wether they were rich or poor and not be defined by his family name, Asher forges his own path.One of the main reason you will adore Asher is because of how much he is a team player and how seriously and how devoted  he takes friendhsips and family. His main <b class="tuck">personality triats </b>are <div class="ken" >extroverted,warm,playful,funny,loyal, and honest <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/shecodesio-production/uploads/files/000/114/295/original/tumblr_nfdii3iez91t1631yo2_500.gif?1707326879"
    alt="Your GIF Alt Text">
</div> . When you need to feel better about yourself,when you need a pick-me up on a grey cloudy day and need some sun, Asher is your right hand man through and through.Additionally, it emphasizes Asher's role as a supportive friend and his positive impact on those around him

    Viola Davis who plays Annalise
    Keating is an amazing actress that I just had to add one one of my favourites! In this show Annalise is a woman  who was orginallly was born Anna Mae Harkness in 1967 and grew up in a poor toxic dysfunctional family. Her father was absent during much of her life and where she was a victim of  sexual abuse in her childhood.As a character alone her backstory for sure made me root for her and her passion for her career later on when she becomes a University proffessor at Middleton and  a criminal defense attorney.What attached me to Annalise as well is that she took all the pain she went through and put it into strength,watching her ambission alone makes you want to get up from your seat and just work and worküí™üèø‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•. One thing a lot of people do not give Annalise enough credit for  is how big of a heart she has, her urge to protect those she cares about in such a motherly way espesially if they have gone through a simliar situation.One thing I definitley relate to with her is since she was a child she has always wanted to feel wanted, wanting to fit in, wanting to belong in a scociety that tells you you don't. In return of that there is this tough extirior that she has had to put on and I think that is something a lot of people can relate to.<b class="tuck">personality triats </b>are <div class="ken">strong,hard worker,ambitious,protective,honest,sympathetic,empathetic,loyal, and forgiving.</div> <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/shecodesio-production/uploads/files/000/114/303/original/jpyu.gif?1707331943

She embodies resilience, strength, and a deep sense of justice, making her the go-to person for resolving complex
